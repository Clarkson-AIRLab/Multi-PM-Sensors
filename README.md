# A smart mobile platform for air quality monitoring


The dynamics of urban particulate matter (PM) is complicated by the large number of PM micro-sources that are spatially and temporally non-uniformly distributed.  Any effort to understand this dynamics and make policies to improve air quality requires the identification of these micro-sources and their complete characterization.  Such an identification/characterization of PM sources is only possible if air quality monitoring is made at high enough spatial and temporal resolution.  Large-scale air quality monitoring, requires networked sensors that are low-cost and compact in size while also being accurate and appropriately sensitive.  With increasing availability of low-cost sensors, large-scale monitoring maybe possible if their measurement accuracy and sensitivity is established under field conditions.  As part of this project, a network-ready platform that can house multiple sensors will be deployed in a pilot study to demonstrate the possibility of making large-scale measurements with commercial low-cost sensors.
